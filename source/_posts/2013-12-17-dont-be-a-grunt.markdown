I've posted some slides I presented at the [OKC Javascript User Group](http://okcjs.com) over Grunt.js titled [Dont be a grunt, use grunt](http://jbavari.github.io/Dont-Be-a-Grunt-Use-Grunt-Slides/). 

I encourage any and all to take any ideas and information from the slides. I'm hoping they provide value to anyone who may want to learn and use Grunt.
