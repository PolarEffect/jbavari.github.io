I spoke about the different Javascript Build systems at KCDC. I wanted to make sure my slides are available to any who wanted to view them.

A few things about the slides:

There is a Gruntfile.js that contains tasks that I talked about in the presentation. There is also a gulpfile.js that does the same tasks as the Gruntfile. It will show you the differences between the two systems.

The slides are found [here](http://jbavari.github.io/JavascriptBuildSystemShowdown/#/)

Enjoy!
